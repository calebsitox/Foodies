🍔 Project: Foodies - For the Love of Good Eats! 🍕
This isn't just my final Software Development project—it's my foodie passion project! I built an app I'd actually geek out over using, because let's be real: who doesn't love discovering amazing restaurants?

📍 The Tech Magic (aka My Google Playground):
I tapped into Google’s awesomeness:

    Geolocation (to find you, hungry human!)

    Places API (the ultimate restaurant Rolodex)

    Maps API (so you never get lost chasing tacos)
    .

🔥 What Foodies Does:

    Restaurant Radar:

        Craving sushi? BBQ? Vegan delights? Search ANYTHING.

        Filter by price 💰, ratings ⭐, cuisine, or "OMG I need this now!" urgency.

    Zero Effort, Max Flavor:

        App magically finds your location → BOOM! Nearby food spots appear.

    Real Talk from Real People:

        See ratings, prices, and savage/glowing reviews before you commit. No regrets!

🚀 My Dev Journey:
Coding Foodies was a blast! I leveled up my dev skills, wrestled APIs into submission, and created something that makes taste buds and tech high-five. 🖐️

Hungry yet? 😉

Personal Experience
Developing Foodies allowed me to apply and refine my technical skills in a practical context. The process was both challenging and deeply rewarding, resulting in an application that delivers a seamless experience for food lovers.
